Unit tests or Unit testing are part of the different procedures that can be carried out within the agile methodology; code that is used to test other code. Small tests created specifically to cover all the requirements of the code and verify its results.

## What are unit tests for?
* Safety net: Prevent unexpected changes in our applications by members of our team or even ourselves.
* Code quality: Continuous improvement of our code. We can review and improve old code or contemplate use cases that we did not take into account when starting development.
* Reduce costs: Prevention and detection of errors at an early age, before they can get out of control.
